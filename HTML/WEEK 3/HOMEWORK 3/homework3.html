                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
                make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve
                never written a line of code. I
                needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me
                learn programming step by step. I
                was encouraged to enroll by a
                former student of theirs who can
                only say wonderful things about
                the program. The entire
                curriculum and staff did not
                disappoint. They were very hands-
                on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project,
                in particular, was outstanding. It
                took my learning to the next level
                in a way that no tutorial could ever
                have. In fact, I’ve often referred to
                it during interviews as an example
                of experience. It certainly helped
                me land a job as a full-stack 100%
                recommend! ”
