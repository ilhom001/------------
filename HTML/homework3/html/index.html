                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I 
                learned were current, if not more so, in the company I 
                joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to 
                make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly 
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. 
                Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a 
                Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
